This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


### Load and install tidyverse package

```{r packages, echo=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

### Use the conflicted package to manage conflicts

```{r }
library(conflicted)
```

###Set dplyr::filter and dplyr::lag as the default choices
```{r}
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr")
conflict_prefer("lag", "dplyr")
```


=====================  
#STEP 1: COLLECT DATA  
=====================  
###load library readr  

```{r}
library(readr)
```


### Upload Divvy datasets (csv file which contains data from january to may 2024 recent data) here  

```{r}
all_trips <- read_csv("F:\\my_Data\\Case_study_1_data\\My_final_analysis\\2024_divvy_bikeshare_analysis\\all_trips1-6month_data.csv")

View(all_trips)
```


====================================================  
#STEP 2: WRANGLE DATA AND COMBINE INTO A SINGLE FILE  
====================================================  
###Compare column names each of the files  
While the names don't have to be in the same order, they DO need to match perfectly before  
we can use a command to join them into one file  
```{r}
colnames(all_trips)
```

###Inspect the dataframes and look for incongruencies  
```{r}
str(all_trips)
```

###Remove latitude, longitude, started_at,as no longer needed  
```{r}
all_trips <- all_trips %>%
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))
colnames(all_trips)
```

======================================================  
#STEP 3: CLEAN UP AND ADD DATA TO PREPARE FOR ANALYSIS  
======================================================  
###Inspect the new table that has been created  
```{r}
colnames(all_trips) #List of column names
nrow(all_trips) #How many rows are in data frame?
dim(all_trips) #Dimensions of the data frame?
head(all_trips) #See the first 6 rows of data frame. Also tail(all_trips)
str(all_trips) #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(all_trips) #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics

```


#There are a few problems we will need to fix:  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
(1) The data can only be aggregated at the ride-level, which is too granular. We will want to  
add some additional columns of data -- such as day, month, year -- that provide additional  
opportunities to aggregate the data.  

(2) We will want to add a calculated field for length of ride since the 2020Q1 data did not have  
the "tripduration" column. We will add "ride_length" to the entire dataframe for consistency.  

(3) There are some rides where tripduration shows up as negative, including several hundred  
rides where Divvy took bikes out of circulation for Quality Control reasons. We will want to  
delete these rides.  

(4) During data cleaning process in excel for 2023Q1 data found column rideable_type with 3 values   
"docked_bike", "electric_bike", "classic_bike", but data after 8/2023 found only 2 values "electric_ 
bike", "classic_bike".  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Add columns that list the date, month, day, and year of each ride  
This will allow us to aggregate ride data for each month, day, or year ... before completing   
these operations we could only aggregate at the ride level  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
< https://www.statmethods.net/input/dates.html> more on date formats in R found at that link  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


```{r}
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at) #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%A")

str(all_trips)
```



###Add a "ride_length" calculation to all_trips (in seconds)  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------  
<https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/difftime.html>  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------  
###creates an column and assign time difference  

```{r}
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at,all_trips$started_at)

```

###Convert "ride_length" from Factor to numeric so we can run calculations on the data  

```{r}
is.factor(all_trips$ride_length)
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))
is.numeric(all_trips$ride_length)

```

###Inspect the column ride_length and look for incongruencies
```{r}
head(all_trips$ride_length, n = 100)
tail(all_trips$ride_length, n = 100)

```

###Inspected some blanks(0's) in data field  
removed all the NA's/blanks in data  
Remove "bad" data  

The data frame includes a few hundred entries when bikes were taken out of docks and  
checked for quality by Divvy / ride_length was negative  
To drop na values drop_na() used part of tidyr package  
We will create a new version of the dataframe (v2) since data is being removed  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
<https://www.datasciencemadesimple.com/delete-or-drop-rows-in-r-with-conditions-2/>  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
###Data removed  

```{r}
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[!(all_trips$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | all_trips$ride_length < 0 
                            | all_trips$ride_length == 0),]

library(tidyr)
all_trips_v3 <- all_trips_v2 %>% drop_na()
View(all_trips_v3)

```

======================================  
#STEP 4: CONDUCT DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS  
=====================================  

###Descriptive analysis on ride_length (all figures in seconds)  
straight average (total ride length / rides)  
midpoint number in the ascending array of ride lengths  
longest ride  
shortest ride  

```{r}
mean(all_trips_v3$ride_length) 
median(all_trips_v3$ride_length) 
max(all_trips_v3$ride_length) 
min(all_trips_v3$ride_length) 

```

You can condense the four lines above to one line using summary() on the specific attribute  

```{r}
summary(all_trips_v3$ride_length)

```

###Compare members and casual users  

```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v3$ride_length ~ all_trips_v3$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips_v3$ride_length ~ all_trips_v3$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips_v3$ride_length ~ all_trips_v3$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips_v3$ride_length ~ all_trips_v3$member_casual, FUN = min)

```

###See the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users  

```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v3$ride_length ~ all_trips_v3$member_casual + all_trips_v3$day_of_week,
          FUN = mean)

```

###Notice that the days of the week are out of order. Let's fix that. 

```{r}
all_trips_v3$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips_v3$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday",
                                                                       "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

```

###Now, let's run the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users  
```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v3$ride_length ~ all_trips_v3$member_casual + all_trips_v3$day_of_week,
          FUN = mean)

```

###Compare electric_bikes and classic_bikes users by agreegating data.  

```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v3$ride_length ~ all_trips_v3$rideable_type, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips_v3$ride_length ~ all_trips_v3$rideable_type, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips_v3$ride_length ~ all_trips_v3$rideable_type, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips_v3$ride_length ~ all_trips_v3$rideable_type, FUN = min)

```

###See the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users by agreegating data.  

```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v3$ride_length ~ all_trips_v3$rideable_type + all_trips_v3$day_of_week,
          FUN = mean)

```

###analyze ridership data by type and weekday  

```{r}
library(dplyr)
all_trips_v3 %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n() #calculates the number of rides and average duration
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% # calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday) # sorts

```

###analyze ridership data by bike type and weekday  

```{r}
all_trips_v3 %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%   #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(rideable_type, weekday) %>%   #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()   #calculates the number of rides and average duration
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%   #calculates the average duration
  arrange(rideable_type, weekday)   #sorts

```

###Let's visualize the number of rides by rider type  

```{r}
all_trips_v3 %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  arrange(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")

```

###Let's visualize the number of rides by bike type  

```{r}
all_trips_v3 %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(rideable_type, weekday) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  arrange(rideable_type, weekday) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = rideable_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")

```

###Load librery ggvis to visualize data  

```{r}
install.packages("ggvis")
library(ggvis)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```

###Let's create a visualization for average duration for member_casual  

```{r}
all_trips_v3 %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  arrange(member_casual, weekday) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") 

```

###Let's create a visualization for average duration for rideable_type  

```{r}
all_trips_v3 %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(rideable_type, weekday) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  arrange(rideable_type, weekday) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = rideable_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") 

```
